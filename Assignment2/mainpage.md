@page main Walkthrough

The main objective of this assignment was to set up a 3D scene with primitives shapes, etc.<br>
We made use of OpenGL's predefined functions to construct the floor, side wall, back wall and the table.
The effort was to set the camera in a position such that the output looks like a front view of the objects.<br>
Zoom, roll, yaw, pitch and pan movements of the camera have been defined to produce different types of movement as mentioned in the assignment.<br>

@section section2 Remarks

@subsection remsubsection1 General Issues

Setting up OpenGL in linux.<br>
Creating a Debug Window.<br>
Setting up a scene using C instead of C++ as openGL functionalities are well implemented with C++.<br>
Management of multiple idle functions.<br>
Defining and coding of camera movement functions in C, which is otherwise easy to implement in C++ using vectors.<br>
